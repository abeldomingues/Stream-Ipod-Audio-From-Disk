# StreamIpodAudioFromDisk
This sample project demonstrates how to stream iPod Library tracks in iOS without having to load the entire audio file into memory.  It also demonstrates how to access the iPod Library from Apple's Core Audio APIs (i.e., without being restricted to an MediaPlayer, AVAudioPlayer or even an AUFilePlayer.)
